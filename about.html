                    <h2><u>About Me</u></h2>
                    <p>Hi! My name is Amaal Rirash. I am recent graduate with a bachelors in chemistry.I've had strong interest in web development, driven by my passion for creating intuitive and visually appealing digital experiences. Though I'm just starting out, I've dedicated myself to learning HTML, CSS, and JavaScript through self-study and small projects. I'm committed to honing my skills and am excited to take the next step by joining this bootcamp, where I can deepen my knowledge and gain the practical experience needed to launch my career in tech.</p>

                    <h2><u>Why did i choose to move into a career as a web developer?</u> </h2>
                    <p>I am passionate about pursuing a career in web development due to my evolving relationship with coding. Although I initially lost interest in computer science during my A-levels due to limited support, my enthusiasm was rekindled when I revisited the subject during my summer break after my second year. I dedicated time to relearning various coding languages and found a renewed appreciation for programming. Additionally, my enjoyment of the computational chemistry module in my degree further solidified my interest in applying my coding skills to solve complex problems. The unique blend of creativity and technical is why i chose to specifically go into web development as well as it offering access to a variety of career paths. This diversity will allow me to choose a specific path based on my strengths that this bootcamp can highlight.</p>
